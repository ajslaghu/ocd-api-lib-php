PHP library for Open Cultuur Data API

This repo consists of a demo index.php and a library file called ocd.php

This allows easy querying of the Open Cultuur Data API, by using fluent interfaces. THis means you can concanete different methods and string to together a query result.

Also the query result is loopable in a foreach loop. In the background new data will be fetched from the API.


Roadmap:
- predefined filters and facets
- getting a list of possible sources
- opening up default query facets
